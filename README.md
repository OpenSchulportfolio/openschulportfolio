OpenSchulPortfolio Builder
==========================

This script creates a full OSP package from scratch by downloading all required components.

The script expects a Linux environment with the following tools available:

  * bash
  * wget
  * GNU tar
  * unzip
  * grep
  * file

Run it with `./build.sh` from the repo as working directory. Delete the `cache` folder to ensure a fresh set of components when you rebuild after a longer time.
